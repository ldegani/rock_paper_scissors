# Project: Rock Paper Scissors Game

<br>
This is my first project using JS with the web.
<br>
Simple implementation of basic concepts to play the game rock paper scissors.
<br>

##### This is a part of the **The Odin Project** curriculum to learn web development.

<br>

### First Part

Used the knowledge in JS that was acquired throw the curriculum to deepen:
<br>
- Conditionals;<br>
- Functions;<br>
- Numbers;<br>
- Variables.
<br>
Making the game fully playable in the console.
<br>
Next step:
<br>
- Use HTML and CSS to style and make it user friendly to play;<br>
- Refactor the JS code to make it better.
